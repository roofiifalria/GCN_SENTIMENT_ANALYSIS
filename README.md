# Sentiment-Enhanced Knowledge Graph for News Articles

A Neo4j-powered knowledge graph that links news articles to entities and performs sentiment analysis to provide insights into media trends. This project scrapes news articles, extracts entities using Named Entity Recognition (NER), analyzes the sentiment of each article, and builds a visual, queryable knowledge graph using Neo4j.

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Scrapes news articles and processes them for analysis.
- **NER and Sentiment Analysis**: Uses pre-trained models to identify entities (people, organizations, locations) and classify sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).
- **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Constructs a graph where articles are linked to entities with sentiment annotations.
- **Visualization**: Graph visualization in Neo4j Bloom.
- **Interactive Queries**: Query and analyze relationships, trends, and insights using Cypher queries.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-knowledge-graph.git
cd sentiment-knowledge-graph
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` should include libraries like:

- `py2neo`
- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `requests`
- `spacy`

### 3. Set up Neo4j

1. Install Neo4j from [Neo4j Download](https://neo4j.com/download/).
2. Create a new Neo4j database and set up your connection:
   - **Default URI**: `bolt://localhost:7687`
   - **Default Username**: `neo4j`
   - Set your password during setup.
3. Open Neo4j Browser or Neo4j Bloom to visualize the graph.

## How to Use

### 1. Scrape Data

Run the `data_scraping.py` script to scrape news articles:

```bash
python data_scraping.py
```

### 2. Perform NER and Sentiment Analysis

Run the `ner_analysis.py` script to perform Named Entity Recognition and Sentiment Analysis:

```bash
python ner_analysis.py
```

### 3. Create/Update the Knowledge Graph

Use the `sentiment.py` script to create or update the knowledge graph in Neo4j:

```bash
python sentiment.py
```

### 4. Visualize in Neo4j Bloom

Open Neo4j Bloom and search for the nodes and relationships using queries like:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Post)-[r:MENTIONS]->(e:Entity) RETURN p, r, e;
```

## Example Queries

1. **Find all posts mentioning a specific entity**:

   ```cypher
   MATCH (p:Post)-[:MENTIONS]->(e:Entity {name: "Google"})
   RETURN p, e;
   ```

2. **Find the most frequently mentioned entities**:

   ```cypher
   MATCH (p:Post)-[:MENTIONS]->(e:Entity)
   RETURN e.name, COUNT(*) AS mentions
   ORDER BY mentions DESC;
   ```

3. **Get posts with positive sentiment**:

   ```cypher
   MATCH (p:Post {sentiment: "positive"}) RETURN p;
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **Neo4j**: For creating and managing the knowledge graph.
- **Python**: For data scraping, NER, sentiment analysis, and graph management.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For performing Named Entity Recognition and sentiment analysis.
